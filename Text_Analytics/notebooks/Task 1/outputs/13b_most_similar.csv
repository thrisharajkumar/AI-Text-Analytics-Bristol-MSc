We are making progress to minimize our environmental impact and maintain resilient global operations by continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions —down 48% since 2008— and water consumption. We remain committed to reducing waste and increasing the use of renewable energy in alignment with our bold new sustainability goals for 2030."
1,"Electricity Electricity is another significant source of carbon emissions. Since we began tracking our electricity use in 2014, our electricity consumption has decreased by 1% despite a 15% expansion in square footage and a 40% increase in headcount.49 Because of this growth, we were unable to achieve our initial 2020 goal of an 18% reduction. However, we continue to focus on reducing electricity through partnering with our landlords and leveraging energy efficiencies. Exhibit 10 provides additional data on our change in headcount versus electricity consumption. We improve energy efficiency through the consolidation of our data centers, retrofitting for LED lighting, redesigning our office space use, and adjusting our heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems to more closely correlate to occupancy."
