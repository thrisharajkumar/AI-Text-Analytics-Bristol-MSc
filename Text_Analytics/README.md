## üìù Task 1: Sentiment Classification on Climate Tweets

### Objective:
To classify the sentiment of climate-related tweets using classical and transformer-based models.

### Methods:
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
  - N-gram and TF-IDF feature extraction
- **Models Implemented**:
  - Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
  - TinyBERT (fine-tuned using HuggingFace)
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
  - Confusion matrix and ROC curves

### Tools:
`Scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `TinyBERT`, `Transformers`, `HuggingFace`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`

---

## üîç Task 2: Topic Modeling

### Objective:
To extract and compare thematic structure from textual climate data using unsupervised topic models.

### Techniques:
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)
- Visualization with pyLDAvis
- Perplexity and coherence score evaluation

### Tools:
`Gensim`, `pyLDAvis`, `SpaCy`, `matplotlib`

---

## üîé Task 3: Named Entity Recognition (NER)

### Objective:
To identify and label named entities from unstructured text using various modeling techniques.

### Models:
- Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
- BiLSTM + CRF
- Fine-tuned **TinyBERT** transformer

### Evaluation:
- F1-score per entity type (e.g., PER, LOC, ORG)
- Entity-level precision and recall
- Span-based evaluation metrics

### Tools:
`sklearn_crfsuite`, `Keras`, `PyTorch`, `HuggingFace Transformers`, `SeqEval`, `SpaCy`
