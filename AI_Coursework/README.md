## üß† Task 1: Semantic Clustering and Vocabulary Engineering

### Objective:
To explore and analyze the **semantic structure** of textual data using **unsupervised learning techniques** and dimensionality reduction.

### Key Steps:
- Built **co-occurrence matrices** from two novels
- Extracted high-frequency nouns and verbs using `spaCy`
- Created frequency-based and LDA-based vocabularies
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensions
- Used **KMeans clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering** to identify groups
- Constructed **semantic graphs** and applied **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** for path analysis
- Compared semantic distances between vocabularies using:
  - **Graph-based distance**
  - **Distributional distance**
  - **LDA-based topic divergence**

### Tools:
`spaCy`, `Gensim`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `NLTK`, `NetworkX`

## ü§ñ Task 2: Supervised Learning & Model Robustness

### Objective:
To implement and evaluate a set of **supervised machine learning models** and assess their **robustness** under different data conditions.

### Models Implemented:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Single-Layer Perceptron**
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**:
  - Small MLP
  - Deep MLP
  - Wide MLP

### Evaluation Scenarios:
Each model was tested across 12 different scenarios combining:
- **Data curvature**
- **Noise levels**
- **Class imbalance**

### Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Learning Curves
- Comparative performance plots

### Key Insights:
- Deep MLP provided the highest robustness across distorted inputs.
- Logistic regression performed poorly under curved and imbalanced data.
- Model complexity helped mitigate noise and non-linearity but increased variance.

### Tools:
`Scikit-learn`, `Keras`, `TensorFlow`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`
