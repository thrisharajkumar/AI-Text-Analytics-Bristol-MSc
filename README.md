# MSc Data Science Coursework â€“ AI & Text Analytics Projects

This repository contains my academic coursework for the MSc Data Science program at the University of Bristol. It highlights applied AI and NLP techniques implemented as part of two major modules:

- **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**
- **Text Analytics**

Each folder includes code, analysis, and a comprehensive PDF report summarizing the findings and methodologies.

## 1. AI_Coursework â€“ Semantic Learning & Supervised Models

### Summary:
This project investigates both **unsupervised** and **supervised learning** models on curated NLP datasets.

### Highlights:
- **Semantic Clustering:** Constructed co-occurrence matrices for two novels, performed PCA, KMeans, hierarchical clustering, and Dijkstra shortest-path analysis.
- **Vocabulary Engineering:** Used POS tagging and LDA to curate topic-based and frequency-based vocabularies.
- **Supervised Models:** Implemented and evaluated:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Single Layer Perceptron
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (Small, Deep, Wide)
- **Robustness Analysis:** Tested models under varied curvature, noise, and class imbalance conditions.

### Technologies:
`Python`, `SpaCy`, `NLTK`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`, `Gensim`

## 2. Text_Analytics â€“ Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling & NER

### Summary:
This project explores classical and deep NLP techniques on real-world datasets, including climate tweets and textual corpora.

### Highlights:
- **Sentiment Classification:**
  - Naive Bayes (TF-IDF, n-grams)
  - Fine-tuned TinyBERT model
- **Topic Modeling:** LDA and HDP applied to uncover latent topics in climate text data.
- **NER Comparison:**
  - CRF, BiLSTM + CRF
  - TinyBERT (transformer-based)

### Technologies:
`Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `BERT`, `PyTorch`, `CRF`, `Gensim`, `HuggingFace Transformers`, `spaCy`
