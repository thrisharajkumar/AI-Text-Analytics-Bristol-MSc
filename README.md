# AI & Text Analytics Coursework
This repository contains project work from the MSc Data Science programme at the University of Bristol, submitted as part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Text Analytics modules (Mar 2025 – May 2025).

## Structure

- AI_Coursework/: Focuses on supervised and unsupervised learning, semantic clustering using NLP techniques, and robustness analysis of AI models.
- Text_Analytics/: Involves real-world NLP tasks such as climate sentiment classification, topic modelling, and named entity recognition (NER).

## AI Coursework: Semantic Clustering & AI Models

Highlights:
- Processed 260K+ tokens from two novels and built semantic clusters using co-occurrence, PCA, KMeans, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Compared vocabularies based on POS-tagging and LDA (95% divergence).
- Evaluated Logistic Regression and 4 types of neural networks across 12 robustness scenarios.
- Deep MLP achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%).

Skills:
NLP, Semantic Clustering, KMeans, PCA, Dijkstra, Neural Networks, Scikit-learn, SpaCy, Gensim, Python

## Text Analytics: Climate Sentiment, Topics, and NER

Highlights:
- Boosted Naïve Bayes accuracy from 69.5% to 75.5% with n-grams and lemmatisation.
- Fine-tuned TinyBERT achieved 77% accuracy on sentiment classification.
- Compared CRF, BiLSTM+CRF, and TinyBERT for NER (TinyBERT F1 on PER: 82.7%).
- Applied LDA/HDP on real-world climate disclosures and Twitter data.

Skills:
Text Classification, NER, Topic Modelling, LDA, HDP, BERT, CRF, BiLSTM, PyTorch, Gensim, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity

## AI Ethics Essay (LLMs & Personhood)
- Argued against granting personhood to LLMs.
- Referenced EU AI Act, Facebook bot shutdown, Cambridge Analytica case.
- Proposed future trajectories for LLM regulation and human-AI coexistence.
